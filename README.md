# questionnairegenerator

This is a simple tool I've built for myself to make generating Discord date questionnaires a bit easier.
Works on windows os. In order to use it:

1. Run `a_generate_questionnaire.py` file *(it will populate questionnaire.txt with data based on date parameter found in file)*
2. Go to `questionnaire.txt` file and remove lines that you don't like
3. Run `b_add_indicators.py` file *(it will add Discord indicators that will make it easier to vote for a given option in questionnaire)*
4. Copy entire content of `questionnaire.txt` file and paste it into any Discord chat that you want.
